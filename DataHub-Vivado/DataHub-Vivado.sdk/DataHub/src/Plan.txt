1. Finish what would be needed to accept a connection as the data hub 
(including responding with sys helath msg)

2. Fix the UDP sending errors

get the C# emulator to send and recv using the samples
work slowly towards comparing sampled with current implemenation
wrost case have to switch the the working sample
